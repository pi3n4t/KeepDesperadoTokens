# KeepDesperadoTokens
This project is a Risk of Rain 2 mod.
It adds the feature of keeping an amount of Desperado tokens, that can be gained by killing enemies with a skill of the Bandit character.

This amount is somewhat configurable and ranges between 0.0 and 1.0. This value serves as a multiplier.
The default value was at least a little playtested to feel "good".
