# KeepDesperadoTokens
This project is a Risk of Rain 2 mod.
It adds the feature of keeping an amount of Desperado tokens, that can be gained by killing enemies with a skill of the Bandit character.

This amount is somewhat configurable and ranges between 0.0 and 100.0 (inclusive). This value serves as a multiplier.
The default value was at least a little playtested to feel "good".


## Changelog
'1.1.0': Now supporting multipliers higher than 1! Up to 100  
'1.0.2': Fix tokens being carried over when quitting to the main menu  
'1.0.1': Updated manifest to contain the correct dependencies  
'1.0.0': Initial release
